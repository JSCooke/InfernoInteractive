General Watson: “Jessie and James, we're detecting robots heading your way now.”
General Watson: “They all seem to be electronic, but don't worry, we can teleport an EMP to the mothership the same way you arrived.”
Jessie: “How long does will it take? They're already here!”
General Watson: “It should appear right about now.”
General Watson: “Use it to disable them! However, its going to need some time before it can be activated...”
General Watson: “So protect it from enemy attacks while it's charging up.”
