General Watson: One more objective to go, and I'm detecting that it's in this maze itself, but there are also far more traps.
Jessie: Yeah, where are those coming from?
General Watson: This was an old training ground of ours, but the alien presence seems to have altered it.
James: Well, that would have been nice to know earlier...
Jessie: Not like it's slowed us down!
James: Don't forget, we can't drop our guard now.
Jessie: That's always been your specialty, James, I'll leave it to you. Let's go!
James: Leaping into action always was your specialty, Jessie. *laughs*
