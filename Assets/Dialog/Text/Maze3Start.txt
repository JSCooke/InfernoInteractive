General Watson: “Good job team, one more map piece to go.”
General Watson: “There are far more traps here, so watch where you are going.”
Jessie: “How do you know that?”
General Watson: “This was an old training ground of ours, but the alien presence seems to have altered it.”
James: “Well, that would have been nice to know earlier...”
Jessie: “Not like it's slowed us down.”
James: “Don't forget, we can't drop our guard now.”
Jessie: “That's always been your specialty, James, I'll rely on you for that.”
James: “Leaping into action was always your specialty, Jessie.” [laughs]
